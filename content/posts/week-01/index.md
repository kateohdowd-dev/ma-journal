I'm really glad to be back on the course and I'm super excited to get started with GDE740 this week. Overall, I feel much more focused after taking a break. I also feel like I've learned a lot about myself and my practise 
while I've been gone - I've been starting to learn web development and coding, and absolutely loving it. I've really been exploring the intersection between design and tech, and I'd love to bring this into my work moving forward!

To kick this module off, we're starting a four week self initiated project. I've really been battling with the challenge of finding time to work on self initiated projects recently. I wish I had more time to dedicate to personal projects, and this is something that was touched on briefly during this week's lecture which I really appreciated. There were so many great insights into the nature and importance of self-initiated projects this week, and I personally feel that self initiated projects are a great way to really reclaim your practise and define who your are as an designer.

## Looking back & initial ideas 
It was reccomended this week that we look back at work from the very first module, GDE710, so I started this week by looking back at my older work. I've been feeling a bit disconnected from my practise recently, so the opportunity to go back over some older work and think about what really matters to me as a practitioner was very helpful. It took me a while to familiarise myself with what I had actually gotten up to in GDE710, as it was technically three years ago now! I feel like I've changed so much as a practitioner and a person since GDE710, but I loved looking back at the work I'd completed, it gave me so many starting points and so much inspiration. 

It was outlined this week that one thing the project needs to do is respond to an issue, cause or narrative that is important to us, so it's important to make sure that this project is valuable and fulfilling, which is something that I always like to try and make sure that my projects are. I'd like to choose a subject or theme that is quite personal, especially considering that the next brief could end up being more commercial. It’s also nice to have the opportunity to take time to work on self initiated projects, and I think by nature a self initiated project should be something that’s personally important. 

## My place in the Industry 
The first thing I did to start this module before I intermitted was consider my identity and my place in the industry. As I mentioned, I feel like I've changed quite a bit since then, so I'd be interested to look back at what I wrote three years ago, and compare it to who I am now. 

### Who am I?
I am a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and front-end developer, with a goal to work in-house as a web designer/developer, a UI/UX designer or as part of design team. My interests include packaging design, brand design, social media and marketing. In my free time, I love to draw, and I enjoy designing characters and drawing/writing comics and graphic novels.

#### Recurrent themes in my work 

- Social justice
- Mental health
- Humour
- Feminism
- Storytelling and narrative

### My Current Skills: 

- Illustration (editorial, commercial, character)
- Graphic design 
- Web Design
- Front-end Development (HTML, CSS, JS, React etc.)
- Brand design and strategy
- Packaging design
- Editorial design
- Creative writing
- Drawing
- Copywriting


### Skills I'd Like to Develop

- Continue learning coding languages (back-end, software dev, etc.) 
- Animation and motion graphics
- Typography (my use of type is and has always been awful.)

It was really interesting to look back at the list I made three years ago, as a lot of the skills that I wanted to develop back then are skills that I have now developed (such as coding), which was great to see! Back then, I wanted to use this project as a way to address some of my skill gaps, and I could certainly still do this. 

This skills audit also helped me to realise that there's a divide in my overall creative practise straight away, between commercial design work and my personal practise (illustration, narrative/graphic novel work). I think as a creative person who works in the creative industry, work and play can become very blurred, as mentioned by Offset Studio in this week's lecture, so I try to keep some aspects of my practise, such as graphic novel and narrative work, exclusively self initiated, with no goal to try to monetise, commercialise or even really share it in any way (unless the opportunity arises, but I won't go searching for it) because it's very personally important and therapeutic to me.

This got me thinking about possibly doing something graphic novel or storytelling based for this project, as I feel like that's a cornerstone of personal, self-initiated practise for me. It might also allow me to experiment with type, layout and hierarchy, which I've indentified as an area I want to work on.  

Before intermitting, I also considered how this project could possibly align with my long-term goals. Initially, I wanted this project to be one that could help me to advance my career, but I realise now, especially after listening to the lecture again, how that goes against everything that a self-initiated project should be. While self-initiated projects can be monestised or commercialised, they're usually something that comes from a personal interest or passion rather than a professional goal. 

However, the other two criteria that I outlined for my project originally I agree with a lot more: 

- I'd like this project to allow for skill development, by enabling me to explore a new area
without fear of failure or judgement. 

- I want this project to send a message. I love using my work to tackle themes and issues that are important to me,
to raise awareness and hopefully help others.

## Previous Ideas from 2023

#### Disability Awareness

Back in 2023 I identified disability/neurodiversity awareness as a recurring theme in my work, especially after looking back at my work for Week 4 of GDE710, 'The Self and Identity' and something I'm deeply passionate about. As someone with a hidden disability myself, I feel like the potential of design and tech to enhance the lives of people with disabilities, as well as help to educate and support carers and loved ones of people with disabilities, is really endless. Really like ‘design your life’ 
Thinking about how technology is used to solve everyday problems

#### Mental health 

One recurring theme that stood out to me when initially brainstorming ideas way back in 2023 was mental health. I've gone through personal struggles with my mental health, and I strongly believe that art, design and tech have huge potential to both be therapeutic as a practise, and can be used as a means to develop solutions for people who are struggling.

(find an artist) 

During my BA, I developed a pack of aggressive affirmation cards that I really wanted to finish but never got the chance to - I love to use humour to enhance these themes because I feel like its a great way of coping. A simple project like finishing those cards or creating something similar could be a nice way to get back into things.

Design based activism 
Burnout rescue box
Like a joke subscription box
Or some kind of product to help with burnout 
Merging narrative with branding and packaging
Humor to deal with mental health problems 
Looking on the bright side
Merges a lot of the elements of my personal practise I think
Yes I think that’s the one

#### Music 

I thought back to my research into design for music posters and the music industry, and the concept of auditory type that I developed, music posters, editorial publication about an artist you love? - challenging but fun

#### Small business 

I get quite frustrated living in Plymouth, because there aren't many in-house tech or design jobs available here. but after looking back at my work for week 2 of GDE710, I realised that a key hallmark of Plymouth's identity is small business, with a particular focus on arts and crafts. In this sense, Plymouth is a great place for designers, as there are small businesses everywhere who are looking for rebrands, logos, websites and even marketing assistance. I identified this as a potential subject for my project, where I could perhaps find a business that resonated with me and create work for them, or maybe create my own brand to develop an identity and strategy for? 

#### Storytelling 
Another huge theme in my work that I identified was the power of storytelling to make social change. As an illustrator first and foremost, storytelling is at the heart of everything I do. Now that I've started to look into coding, programming and web, I feel like there are so many unique ways to tell stories and share them. I developed a zine of testimonies while making the spiking project that gave the project a personal touch.

Maybe something related to this?

Mmm interesting tasty

## Current Ideas

As well as looking back at ideas from my first attempt at this module, I went back over my work for GDE710 with fresh eyes to see what stood out to me, and to try and develop some ideas for this module. 

I really loved the work I did for week 2, 'Industry Today', when we looked at the history of design. This was really a first look into the history of design for me and I found it absolutely fascinating. 

Identity - disability, graphic novels, The ‘self’ - self branding? A parody of a portfolio/landing page that gets darker to depict a lack of sense of self?

The ‘human touch’ (traditional materials, packaging, etc.) -
illustration in packaging?

Sketchbooks - looking, seeing, understanding, capturing and recording, sketch vs photo - seeing vs understanding, challenging perceptions, experiences and memories, editorial design, process as final product? What about a packaging series made of half finished sketches. Love the process?
