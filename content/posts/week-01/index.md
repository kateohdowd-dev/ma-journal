I'm really glad to be back on the course and I'm super excited to get started with GDE740 this week. Overall, I feel much more focused after taking a break. I also feel like I've learned a lot about myself and my practise 
while I've been gone - I've been starting to learn web development and coding, and absolutely loving it. I've really been exploring the intersection between design and tech, and I'd love to bring this into my work moving forward!



To kick this module off, we're starting a four week self initiated project. I've really been battling with the challenge of finding time to work on self initiated projects recently. I wish I had more time to dedicate to personal projects, and this is something that was touched on briefly during this week's lecture which I really appreciated. There were so many great insights into the nature and importance of self-initiated projects this week, and I personally feel that self initiated projects are a great way to really reclaim your practise and define who your are as an designer.

## Looking back & initial ideas 
It was reccomended this week that we look back at work from the very first module, GDE710,   I started this week by looking back at my older work. I've been feeling a bit disconnected from my practise recently, so the opportunity to go back over some older work and think about what really matters to me as a practitioner was very helpful. It took me a while to familiarise myself with what I had actually gotten up to in GDE710, as it was technically three years ago now! I feel like I've changed so much as a practitioner and a person since GDE710, but I loved looking back at the work I'd completed, it gave me so many starting points and so much inspiration. 

The one thing the project needs to do is respond to an issue, cause or narrative that is important to us, so it's important to make sure that this project is valuable and fulfilling, which is something that I always like to try and make sure that my projects are.

## My place in the Industry 
The first thing I did to start this module before I intermitted was consider my identity and my place in the industry. As I mentioned, I feel like I've changed quite a bit since then, so I'd be interested to do the same thing now. 

### Who am I?
I am a freelance graphic designer, illustrator and front-end developer, with a goal to work in-house as a web designer/developer, a UI/UX designer or as part of design team. My interests include packaging design, brand design, social media and marketing. In my free time, I love to draw, and I enjoy designing characters and drawing/writing comics and graphic novels.

### My Current Skills: 

- Illustration (editorial, commercial, character)
- Graphic design 
- Web Design
- Front-end Development (HTML, CSS, JS, React etc.)
- Brand design and strategy
- Packaging design
- Editorial design
- Creative writing
- Drawing
- Copywriting

### Skills I'd Like to Develop

- Continue learning coding languages (Back-end, software dev, etc.) 
- Animation and motion graphics
- Typography (my use of type is and has always been awful)

It was really interesting to look back at the list I made initially three years ago, as a lot of the skills I have now, I didn't have back then (such as coding). Before intermitting, I wanted to use this project as a way to address some of these gaps, and I could still do this. 

This skills audit also helped me to realise that there's a divide in my overall creative practise straight away, between commercial design work and my personal practise (illustration, narrative/graphic novel work). I think as a creative person who works in the creative industry, work and play can become very blurred, so I try to keep some aspects of my practise, such as graphic novel and narrative work, exclusively self initiated, with no goal to try to monetise it in any way (unless the opportunity arises, but I won't go searching for it) because it's very personally important and therapeutic to me.

This got me thinking about possibly doing something graphic novel or storytelling based for this project, as I feel like that's a cornerstone of personal, self-initiated practise for me. It might also allow me to experiment with type, layout and hierarchy, which I've indentified as an area I want to work on.  

# Recurrent themes in my work 

Based on these insights, I came up with some reccurrent themes that cropped up in my old work a lot.

- Social justice
- Mental health
- Humour
- Feminism


I also considered my goals, and based on this, decided that I wanted my self initiated project to adhere the following criteria:
​
I wanted it to advance my career (portfolio-worthy, relates to
one of the areas in which I'd like to find work in the future, will
help me to pick up clients.)

Allows for skill development (enables me to explore a new area
without fear of failure or judgement)

Will send a message (Tackles a theme that is important to me,
and aims to will raise awareness and help others)
​
With this criteria in mind, I looked back through my work for GDE710, and made mind map of ideas for each week, picking out topics and areas that really interested me and that I thought could fulfil my aims for this project.
Look at web projects that tell stories

I then narrowed this down further, and took my favourite ideas from these and developed a larger mind map of rough potential ideas (this might seem like overkill, but I really wanted to make sure I found the right project for this brief.)

Initial Ideas
Disability awareness -
A common theme that is very important to me is disability awareness. I touched on this briefly during GDE710, and it's generally a theme that I find myself coming back to again and again. As someone with a hidden disability, it's a huge and unavoidable element of my life that I've experiences and lot of turmoil with, so any chance to use my experiences to make the lives of neurodivergent people better is hugely worthwhile for me. I came up with a couple of ideas surrounding this theme, such as developing a website that serves as a digital experience to . I also considered how I could bring disabled people into the project, such as running workshops - could I gather some sketches from autistic people turned into packaging for a brand that supports neurodiverse people?
Mental health -
During my BA, I developed a pack of aggressive affirmation cards which I really wanted to finish but never got a chance to. I love to joke about because I feel like its a great way of coping - a nice way to get back into things, simple task with big illustrative focus, app, graphic novel
Music -
I thought back to my research into design for music posters and the music industry, and the concept of auditory type that I developed, music posters, editorial publication about an artist you love? - challenging but fun

The ‘human touch’ (traditional materials, packaging, etc.) -
illustration in packaging?

​
Impact of tech (ai) -
could link to human touch, why ai design and artwork sucks, publication? Study? 
Medium vs message 
Small business (visual culture) - website, zine, study, packaging and branding? For like 3 small businesses? To get me working with clients commercially
Identity - disability, graphic novels, The ‘self’ - self branding? A parody of a portfolio/landing page that gets darker to depict a lack of sense of self?
Storytelling - the power of storytelling to make social change - graphic novels, mental health, social justice
Testimonies? A bit cheesy and kind of already done that 
New products - packaging, branding, tackling homelessness, cost of living, food for all? 
Pushing boundaries - tech 
https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/digital-art-nft-david-rudnick-trevor-jackson-the-balancing-act-creative-industry-170322 
Addressing skill gaps - go back over 
Graphic novels 
Sketchbooks - looking, seeing, understanding, capturing and recording, sketch vs photo - seeing vs understanding, challenging perceptions, experiences and memories, editorial design, process as final product? What about a packaging series made of half finished sketches. Love the process?

https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/robin-guillemin-graphic-design-040920 
Mental health also - journals, how to capture feelings and abstract experiences? Turn these into packaging designs? idk
How to capture abstract experiences - vibe > sense 
https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/amy-moss-illustration-270421 
Could link to autism in some way?
Journalling 
Finding myself again
Memories (capturing memories, memo mori)
https://www.itsnicethat.com/features/henry-gorse-my-yard-changemakers-grange-farm-book-photography-240322 
Life more abundant
Digital horror
Digital storytelling (args etc)
Social media marketing 
Considering that the next brief is likely to be very commercial, I think I’ll choose something quite personal. It’s nice to have the opportunity to take time to work on self initiated projects, and I think by nature a self initiated project should be something that’s personally important. 



Really like ‘design your life’ 
Thinking about how technology is used to solve everyday problems

Design based activism 
Burnout rescue box
Like a joke subscription box
Or some kind of product to help with burnout 
Merging narrative with branding and packaging
Humor to deal with mental health problems 
Looking on the bright side
Merges a lot of the elements of my personal practise I think
Yes I think that’s the one
Narrative through social media marketing? Like an ARG to promote 
Mmm interesting tasty

Your research task this week is to assess the field of communication within which you want to develop your self initiated project.
​
design and mental health 
packaging design
brand design
web design possibly and social media marketing 
looking at some of the examples last year
people who use social media to spin narratives and create engaging experiences 
​
Who are the designers, artists and makers that are critical to this area of design? How might their work inform your own creative direction?

## Current Ideas

As well as looking back at ideas from my first attempt at this module, I went back over my work for GDE710 with fresh eyes to see what stood out to me, and to try and develop some ideas for this module. 

I really loved the work I did for week 2, 'Industry Today', when we looked at the history of design. This was really a first look into the history of design for me and I found it absolutely fascinating.
