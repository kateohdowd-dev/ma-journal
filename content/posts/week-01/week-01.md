I'm really glad to be back on the course and I'm super excited to get started with GDE740 this week. Overall, I feel much more focused after takikng a break. I also feel like I've learned a lot about myself and my practise 
while I've been gone - I've been starting to learn web development and coding, and absolutely loving it. I've been exploring the intersection between design and tech, and I'd love to bring this into my work moving forward!

To kick this module off, we're starting a four week self initiated project. I've really been battling with the challenge of finding time to work on self initiated projects recently. I wish I had more time to dedicate to personal projects, and this is something that was touched on briefly during this week's lecture which I really appreciated. There were so many great insights into the nature and importance of self-initiated projects this week, and I personally feel that self initiated projects are a great way to really reclaim your practise and define who your are as an designer.

## Looking back & initial ideas 
It was reccomended this week that we look back at work from the very first module, GDE710,   I started this week by looking back at my older work. I've been feeling a bit disconnected from my practise recently, so the opportunity to go back over some older work and think about what really matters to me as a practitioner was very helpful. It took me a while to familiarise myself with what I had actually gotten up to in GDE710, as it was technically three years ago now! I feel like I've changed so much as a practitioner and a person since GDE710, but I loved looking back at the work I'd completed, it gave me so many starting points and so much inspiration. 

The one thing the project needs to do is respond to an issue, cause or narrative that is important to us, so it's important to make sure that this project is valuable and fulfilling, which is something that I always like to try and make sure that my projects are, anyway.
