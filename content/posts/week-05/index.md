This week, we're starting the second brief of this module, 'Industry Set', where we will work on a live industry brief as opposed to a personal project.

I'm really excited to get started with this project. (talk about self initiated and how you felt). When I first looked into the brief choices for this project, I was a little overwhelmed, but I'm looking forward to choosing something to move forward with. I'm looking forward to taking the opportunity to step back into collaborative, commercial work. I started this week by listening to the industry practitioners give insights during this week's lecture, which I'm hoping will further help me to choose a brief to move forward with. 

## Lecture Reflections

> “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life." *Confucius*

This week marked the beginning of the 'Industry Set' brief, a project that shifts our focus from self-initiated exploration to live, client-led collaboration. This week's lecture offered invaluable insights into how creative professionals identify, evaluate, and pursue new industry opportunities. Hearing from Torsten Posselt (FELD), Matthew Jones and Michelle Dona (Accept and Proceed), Wouter Dirks (Studio Dumbar), and Stijn van de Ven and Luke Veerman (Eden Spiekermann) gave a nuanced view of what it means to align one’s creative practice with professional goals.

What stood out to me most in this week's lecture was the balance between personal authenticity and professional adaptability. Torsten Posselt reminded me that while it’s natural to gravitate toward projects that align with personal interests, there’s great value in stepping outside of our comfort zones. He described how choosing projects without an immediate emotional connection can open up new ways of thinking, introducing play, curiosity, and experimentation into the process. I found this liberating — it challenged my instinct to only pursue projects that “fit” my established interests. It made me realise that growth often happens when we enter unfamiliar territory and let ourselves respond intuitively to something new.

Matthew Jones and Michelle Dona from Accept and Proceed offered a slightly different perspective, one that emphasised intentionality. They spoke about knowing who you are as a designer, defining your criteria for the types of projects you want to take on, and being deliberate about the clients you attract. Their advice to “develop self-initiated projects in your niche to attract clients that align with it” particularly resonated with me. It made me think about how personal work can act as a magnet — by showcasing what we care about, we attract others who value the same things. I can see this being especially relevant as I begin developing my professional identity and portfolio beyond my the course.

Wouter Dirks from Studio Dumbar highlighted the importance of networking and allowing opportunities to grow organically. His view that “as you develop, clients will come to you” reframed how I think about visibility. Rather than chasing every opportunity, it’s about consistency, credibility, and building relationships within a community. It’s a slower but more sustainable approach, one that prioritises connection over competition.

The practitioners from Eden Spiekermann, Stijn van de Ven and Luke Veerman, gave a particularly grounded take on professional growth. Stijn’s advice to *“find problems you want to solve and topics that resonate with you”* really struck a chord. It echoed something I’ve been realising through my own projects: that passion fuels perseverance. When you care deeply about a subject, the work becomes more meaningful and you’re far more likely to see it through. However, he also emphasised the importance of being honest about your abilities — recognising when to push yourself and when to rely on your strengths. This was a valuable reminder that while risk and experimentation are vital in self-initiated work, client projects demand reliability and responsibility.

Luke Veerman expanded on this by discussing the benefits of specialisation. He suggested that focusing on one niche allows designers to build authority, confidence, and transferable skills, positioning them as experts in that space. I found his words thought-provoking, especially when he linked this idea to lifelong learning. The idea that “you are never finished developing.” It reminded me that mastery doesn’t mean stagnation; rather, it’s an ongoing process of refining, evolving, and continuously learning.

Overall, this week’s lecture made me reflect on the importance of balance — between personal growth and professional focus, between curiosity and competence. It’s encouraged me to think more strategically about the types of projects I take on, both in terms of what excites me creatively and what will help me develop professionally.

As I prepare to select a brief for the Industry Set project, I plan to carry these insights forward by:
– Choosing a project that challenges me while still aligning with my values and skill set.
– Reflecting on what kind of designer I want to become, and what types of clients I want to attract.
– Using this project as an opportunity to practice professionalism, adaptability, and self-direction.

I think this week really reinforced that finding your place in the industry isn’t about waiting for the “perfect” project — it’s about defining who you are, staying curious, and remaining open to the opportunities that help you grow.

## Further Research

## Webinar Notes


## Research Task

Our research task this week was to carefully read, analyse and reflect upon the ‘Industry Set’ project brief, and to carefully consider the problem/insight that we might identify and the theme we'd like to work with. The brief is quite broad, which mis very exciting and means that we can really identify a direction that resonates with us, so I'm aiming to find a focus that will be fulfilling for me, as well as successfully meets the brief. 

We were also asked to consider the benefits and drawbacks that our ideas might offer, and the main hurdles that they might present us with creatively. I'm looking forward to getting started with this project, as I'm excited to explore areas of my professional practise that are more commercial than those I'd explored in the last brief. For me, collaboration will always be a huge part of my practise, whether I continue to freelance, or end up working in-house with an agency or business, so I'm always keen to hone my skills in following a brief and actioning external feedback. 

The first thing I did was to take a long look at the museum website, and really get stuck into the collection. I was really blown away by the range of the artwork, and
