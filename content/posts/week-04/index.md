This week, we're concluding our self-initiated project, and evaluating and reflecting on our outcomes. 

 we would like you to evaluate how successful you were at engaging with your target audience. 

We also want you to consider how your relationship with the subject has changed over the last four weeks and reflect on what you have learned from the inception of the project to its completion.

When analysing the success of your final outcome, you may wish to consider what you might have done differently and identify any pivotal turning points that changed the direction of your final outcome. 

Be critical about the final outcome of your project, and engage with your peers and individuals outside of the creative industries, to analyse your ability to engage with your target audience.

## Lecture Reflections

> “An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail.” *Edwin Land*

This week’s lecture focused on development — the stage in which ideas evolve from concepts into refined outcomes through experimentation, risk-taking, and reflection. Listening to practitioners such as Christoff Miller (Offshore Studio), Veronica Fuerte (Hey), Vince Frost, Sam Bompas (Bompas & Parr), and James Stringer (Werkflow) offered a valuable insight into the diverse and often unpredictable processes behind creative development.

What particularly stood out to me was how differently each practitioner defined “development.” For Christoff Miller, the process is fluid and hands-on; he emphasised the importance of trying ideas early, even before they felt fully formed. I found this approach refreshing because it embraces imperfection as a necessary part of creative progress. Christoff described how he and his partner have completely different working rhythms — his partner's is methodical, whereas his is less linear and more impulsive. This reminded me that there’s no single “correct” creative process, and has encouraged me to lean into my own less-linear way of working, to view pauses or detours not as failures, but as integral stages of development. I also really resonated with Christoff's point that taking breaks helps to reset the eye, which served as a reminder that rest and distance can often clarify creative decisions more effectively than overworking a design can.

Veronica Fuerte’s reflections on the challenge of simplicity offered a compelling contrast. Her work for Hey may appear minimalistic and effortless, but she explained that this simplicity still demands a rigorous and disciplined process. I found this reassuring, as my own work illustration work is often quite minimalistic, so I felt vindicated to hear someone else say that that what looks simple can still involve enormous complexity behind the scenes. It made me reflect on my own project and how I often underestimate the refinement stage, and made me realise that simplicity shouldn’t be mistaken for ease; it’s a product of thoughtful reduction and an acute sense of balance, something I’d like to explore in my own outcomes.

Vince Frost’s comment that “in self-initiated projects, you are the client” was a highlight of this week's lecture for me. It reframed how I think about autonomy in design. Without a client to set parameters, the challenge becomes to create those boundaries for yourself. Vince spoke about “living with the work” — printing it out, hanging it up, and letting it sit until it feels right. I loved this tactile, slow-burn approach and would like to adopt it in my own process, perhaps by printing iterations of my designs and revisiting them throughout development, going with my gut and sitting with them until they 'feel' right. Vince also spoke candidly about self-doubt and the struggle to self-direct, which I related to deeply. I often find self-initiated work overwhelming because of perfectionism and the lack of external validation, so hearing him acknowledge that even established designers wrestle with this was reassuring.

Sam Bompas offered a radically different view on reflection — claiming that he “never reflects” because there’s “never time.” At first, I found this attitude surprising, but the more he explained, the more sense it made in the context of his highly experimental practice. Sam described sleep as a vital part of his creative process, as it’s when ideas incubate subconsciously. I found that fascinating — it reminded me that reflection doesn’t always have to be formal or structured; sometimes the best insights happen when we step away entirely. Sam's process reaffirmed the idea that creativity thrives in both action and rest, and that over-analysis can sometimes stifle experimentation.

James Stringer of Werkflow discussed development from a production and collaboration standpoint. His iterative, team-based process highlighted how creative development in digital media involves constant testing, evaluation, and adaptation. I found it particularly useful when he mentioned breaking large projects into milestones — a practical approach I’d like to apply to my own project timeline to keep myself on track. James' emphasis on seeing the work “through the eyes of the audience” was another reminder that development isn’t just about making something better technically, but about strengthening its emotional and communicative impact.

Across all speakers, a recurring theme was risk. Christoff Miller described self-initiated projects as safe spaces for risk-taking — places where failure is not only possible but essential. His quote, “We want personal projects to be a place of learning for us,” really stayed with me. It reframed failure as a form of research. Christoff, similarly to Vince, also pointed out the paradox of perfectionism: that the freedom of self-initiated projects can sometimes paralyse you. This insight hit close to home, as this week, I've actually found myself hesitating to move forward with my own project for fear it won’t live up to my ambitions or vision. Miller’s words reminded me that progress happens through revision, not hesitation, and that development is inherently messy.

Vince Frost and Veronica Fuerte also spoke about risk in the context of ambition. Veronica's decision to open a physical shop after years of running an online studio was a huge professional gamble, but one that paid off in creating a tangible brand experience. Vince, meanwhile, spoke of his ongoing battles with funding and burnout — real-world factors that affect creative outcomes. Hearing this made me appreciate that development isn’t only an aesthetic journey but an emotional and logistical one as well.

Ultimately, this week’s lecture encouraged me to embrace risk and imperfection in my process. I’ve realised that development isn’t about polishing an idea to perfection, but allowing it to evolve through trial, error, and reflection.

I'm planning to carry these lessons into my self-initiated project by:

- Prototyping ideas early, rather than overthinking them.
- Printing and “living with” my designs, as Vince suggested.
- Building in space for rest, reflection, and iteration.
- Treating experimentation and mistakes as valuable research rather than setbacks.

As Paul Arden once wrote, *“It’s wrong to be right.”* This week’s lecture reminded me that progress comes from being brave enough to be wrong first.






## Research Task

Your research task this week is to assess the field of communication within which you want to develop your self initiated project.
​
design and mental health 
packaging design
brand design
web design possibly and social media marketing 
looking at some of the examples last year
people who use social media to spin narratives and create engaging experiences 
​
Who are the designers, artists and makers that are critical to this area of design? How might their work inform your own creative direction?
